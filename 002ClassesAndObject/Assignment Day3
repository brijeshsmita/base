1> create a class Student 
 with the following instance variables
private int rollNo;
private static int id;//use it to auto-generate the rollNo
private String sname;
private double [] marks;
private static String collageName;

->Two method 
	-> calculateMarks(double ... marks)//use varArg
 	-> print()
->Override toString()
	-> return all properties of student,except and return calculateMarks
	   instead of marks
->create main and in that create 3 object of Student and call
 overloaded constructor on each of them
 and print all the three objects
  
2>create a class Account 
 with the following instance variables
private int accNo;
private static int id;//use it to auto-generate the rollNo
private String accHolderName;
private String [] phone;//2 save 2 phone numbers
private String email;
private double curBal;
private static String bankName;
->Two method 
	-> public boolean checkBalance(double amount){
//if amount is less then balance then return false else return true
	}
 	-> showAccDetails()//to print account details
	->Override ToString()
	-> return all properties of Account
	-> public void deposit(double amount)
	-> public void withdraw(double amount){
		//call checkBalance(amount) to check balance first
		//if true the print appropriate message
		//else print low balance message  
		//perform withdraw
	}
->create main and in that create 3 object of Account and call
 overloaded constructor on each of them
 and print all the three objects
 1st object is withdrawing 1000
 2nd object is withdrawing 2000 and depositing 4000
 3rd  object is withdrawing 1400 and depositing 6500 
 call showAccDetails on all the 3 objects
 
 3>create a class TestAccountVarArg
 	->create a method 
 		public static void printAllAccount(Account ... accArr){
 			//code to print all Account in passed through varArg
 		}
 	
 	In main method
 	-> create 4 objects of Account calling overloaded constructor
 	-> call printAllAccount(pass all the 4 Account object)
