======================ABSTRCAT CLASS=======================
1>A class which is marked with abstract non-access specifier
	which cannot be instantiated IS CALLED AS ABSTRACT CLASS
2> Abstract class is meant for sub-classes
3> used for further extensibility of code
4> thus must be extended by other class
eg: abstract class BankAccount{
}
5> A class which has any abstract method must be declared as abstract
6> if a class extends any abstract class then it must override
all the abstract method OR mark the class itself as an abstract class
7> Abstract class can have both abstract as well as concrete method
8> yes we can have constructor in  an abstract class but why we need them 
if we can't instantiate Abstract Class??
//constructors are allowed coz in inheritance
	//constructor is called super to sub
9> A class which does not have any abstract method can also
be marked as abstract.
======================ABSTRCAT METHOD=======================
1> ABSTRACT METHOD are marked with abstract non-access modifier
2> does not have body and terminated with semicolan
eg: 
	public abstract deposit(double amount);
3> must to be overridden by the subclass
eg: class SavingAccount extends BankAccount{
	public deposit(double amount){
		sysout("amount depoited");
		curBal+=amount;
	}
}
