 * fixed number of well-known values
 * eg: days, month, payment mode,
 * enums in java are type safe.

//enum can also extends a class and inplements interface
//values() is in-build method of enum which returns an array of enum constant
//name() method is also in-build which return the name of the constant of enum
//toString() inbuild
//we can use enum in switch case 
//we can compare two enum with == and equals()
//constants are implicitly static and final
///constructor in enum must be private
//enum implicitly implements Serializable and Comparable interface
//we can define abstract method inside an enum, each constant then implements 
//each abstract method independently
