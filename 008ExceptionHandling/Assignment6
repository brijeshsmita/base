1> create a class MyFile which will implement
AutoCloseable interface
	-method openFile(){}
-Now create UseFile class
where in main method 
use try with resource block to create object of MyFile class
and call openFile() method within it

2> create an interface EmployeeService	
	public Employee addEmployee(Employee emp)
	public Employee findById(int empId);
	public Employee findByName(String ename);
	public Employee [] findAllEmployees();	
 -> create a class EmployeeServiceImpl which implements
 	EmployeeService interface

 	-in findById() method throw User Defined Exception EmployeeNotFound
 	if employee not found
 	-in findByName() method throw User Defined Exception EmployeeNotFound
